How to enable ligatures
You need to explicitly enable ligatures support in following editors:

Atom
Brackets
Cloud9
Jetbrains' products (IntelliJ, etc)
Emacs
MacVim
VS Code
BBEdit
LightTable
Sublimetext
For other editors it must be enough to simply select Fira Code as your font of choice. Full list of supported editors

Troubleshooting
1. Make sure the font your editor displays is actually Fira Code
Easiest way is to compare the shape of @ & and r with the reference image:



Issues: #393 #373 #227

2. Make sure you’ve enabled ligatures in your editor
Consult this wiki (see above ↑) for instruction on how to do that.

Issues: #291

3. Make sure you’re on the latest version of Fira Code
Consult CHANGELOG to see when it was last updated.

4. Check the list of known issues below ↓
Known issues
Hinting issues
Uneven spacing in === and !== at certain font sizes, esp. on Windows #405 #243 #119 #114

Different height of [] at certain font sizes #332 #251

Powerline characters are of slightly wrong size
Unfortunately this can’t be fixed for all terminals because they have different ways of calculate font metrics. See this comment

Issues: #426 #131 #44

Some ligatures work while some don’t
This is an issue with your editor and how it handles tokenization/syntax highlighting. Nothing can be done in a font to work around that. Report your problem to the corresponding editor’s issue tracker.

All ligatures with dashes in Visual Studio (not Code) #422 #395 #360 #273 #259 #233 #220 #196 #181 #157 #99 #43 #32

Ligatures in column 100 in VS Code #403 #397 #372

Atom/VS Code are known to break certain ligatures in certain syntaxes #361 #353 #348 #328 #326 #235

Corrupted font in IntelliJ on Windows
Go to C:\Windows\Fonts with cmd.exe, find and delete everything having Fira in the file name. It’s important that you use terminal commands, not Explorer.

Anything related to italics
Fira Code does not have italics at all. If you see italicized glyphs it means your editor is “faking” them.
